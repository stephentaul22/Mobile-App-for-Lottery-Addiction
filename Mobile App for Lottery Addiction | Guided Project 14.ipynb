The 6/49 Lottery is a lottery in which a player chooses 6 numbers from a list of 49 numbers (valued 1-49). A contestant wins this lottery if they match all 6 of their numbers on one ticket with the winning numbers of that week. The lottery is played every week. A contestant can purchase as many lottery tickets as they would like, and there are consolation prizes for matching 2 to 5 of the numbers."
